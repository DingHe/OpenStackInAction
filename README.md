#On DevStack

In my opinion you should attempt to clone the stable branch of both DevStack and its related OpenStack code from the OpenStack repositories, as described in the book.

If you are having trouble with this approach I would recommend using the companion VM (announced on forum).

Based on reader request, the DevStack script and OpenStack code used in the companion VM has been uploaded to the Github repository for the book. 

Scripts:
* /scripts/icehouse/opt/devstack
* /scripts/icehouse/opt/stack
